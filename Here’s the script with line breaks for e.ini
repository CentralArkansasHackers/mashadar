1. Channel Introduction
“Welcome to Terminal Grin, where we dive deep into the world of cybersecurity, hacking walkthroughs, and red team insights.

If you’re here to level up your skills, whether you’re a beginner or looking to take that next step into advanced techniques, you’re in the right place.

I’m [Your Name], your guide on this journey.”

2. Series Introduction
“This video kicks off an exciting series where we’ll be tackling the Game of Active Directory, or GOAD for short.

Specifically, we’re going to be hacking the Ninja Hacking Academy Lab, one of the most realistic and challenging environments out there for learning Active Directory exploitation.

But before we get to the fun stuff—breaking things—we need to build the lab.”

3. Video Overview
“In this first set of videos, I’ll walk you through deploying GOAD.

We’ll start on a MacBook, then on a Windows PC, and maybe even on Linux if enough of you request it in the comments.

After the lab is up and running, we’ll move on to setting up Mythic C2 infrastructure to manage our operations.

And finally, we’ll start hacking!

Step by step, I’ll show you how to enumerate, exploit, and escalate within the Ninja Hacking Academy Lab.”

4. Format and Style
“This series is going to be as close to live as possible.

You’ll see everything—successes, mistakes, and the occasional ‘why is this not working’ moment.

Don’t worry, though—I’ll edit out the staring-at-the-screen-while-cursing-my-existence moments to keep it fun and engaging.”

5. Audience Engagement
“If you’re setting up GOAD or learning about C2 infrastructure, follow along with me.

And if there’s anything specific you want to see, like deploying GOAD on Linux or other advanced scenarios, drop it in the comments—I’m here to make content that helps you grow.”

6. Call to Action
